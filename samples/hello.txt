Hello hacker school! I'm presenting a small application I'm working on, called *abba*. Abba is an abbreviation generator. It reads in a set of rules of text substitutions, applies them in sequence, and then returns the resulting text. What's sort of fun is that the text is not necessarily returned as a string: the text substitutions are not performed as string operations, but rather the substitutes are inserted into the text in the form of unicode control characters taken from the private use area, that refer back to abbreviation objects. These objects can therefore report on their output in a number of ways.
