    
    Veranius, being superior to all
    300,000 of my friends in my eyes
    Have you come home to your household gods
    and loving brothers and old mother?
    Youve come back! o happy news for me!
    I will see you unharmed and i will hear
    you telling about places of the spaniards, the deeds, the tribes
    as it is your custom, and drawing your neck close
    will I kiss the delightful eyes and lips?
    O how many happy men there are,
    who is happier and more blessed than I am?
